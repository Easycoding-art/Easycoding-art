***Hi there ðŸ‘‹*** My name is **Mikhail Sedinkin**. Currently I'm a student at NRNU MEPhI, Moscow, Russian Federation. I am interested in ML, DL, NLP, CV and RecSys.

### :computer: List of technologies

My main programming language is Python, due to it's useability for programming and performing machine learning models. I am familiar both with classical methods (linear and logistic regression, gradient boosting, KNN, Random Forest, naive Bayesian etc.) and deep learning models. I use Google Colab and other tools to train models. Also you can check out my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/mikhailsedinkin).

You can see set of mostly used technologies and libraries below:
